    3 lbs/1,5 kg cherry tomatoes, you can use big tomatoes, just cut them in half or quarters, and remove the tough part
    1 big or 2 smaller red onions
    I used 3 small snack peppers, you can use any kind any kind you like
    A whole head of garlic, 8-12 cloves
    2 sprigs rosemary
    1,5-2 tablespoons fresh thyme
    Olive oil, a generous amount when roasting the tomatoes
    1 big or 2 smaller white onion
    2 tablespoons/30g butter
    1 tablespoon tomato paste
    2,75 Cups/660ml vegetable stock, you can use chicken stock too if you want
    1 tablespoon dried oregano
    Cayenne pepper or chili, according to taste
    1 teaspoon smoked or sweet paprika
    Half a tablespoon balsamic vinegar
    1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
    Half a teaspoon sugar
    A good handful fresh basil leaves
    0,5 Cup/120ml heavy cream(optional)
    Salt and black pepper


Note: For a smoother, velvety texture, sieve the soup after blending it!
I don`t mind tasting some of the tomato seeds and the skin, but it`s up to you!

In a large tray mix the tomatoes, garlic, peppers, red onion, rosemary and thyme, add generous amount of olive oil, salt and pepper and roast in a preheated oven, fan on 375F/190C until caramelized, about 50-60 minutes. When ready, saute the white onion in the butter in a fairly large pot, add the tomato paste, mix it and add all the roasted tomatoes from the tray. Add the stock, cayenne pepper, smoked paprika, balsamic vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper, if needed and the fresh basil. Let it simmer on the stove for 8-10 minutes. After that time, take it off the stove and blend everything together. Take it back to the stove and add the cream, when it starts to simmer, turn it off, it`s ready! Taste it and season with more salt and pepper if needed.
Serve with toast with cheese of your choice, I`ve used mozzarella and cheddar!
Enjoy!
